node-x509-keygen
================
node.js module to generate self-signed certificate via openssl spawn.

This could be done using the [RUSA](https://github.com/Obvious/ursa) package for node,
but that doesn't seem to have a robust update rate.
Instead, this code is based on @ericvicenti's approach for [ssh-keygen](https://github.com/ericvicenti/ssh-keygen).
